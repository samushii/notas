## Vulnerability Scanners

tools like Nessus (paid but has a free version) and OpenVAS can be used to run scans against defined targets, they will then generate a report

scans are highly customizable and can include a plethora of different plugins for detecting vulnerabilities

## Reporting

at the end of an assessment a report should be submitted, it should consist of the following sections:

- ### Executive Summary
	- Intended to be read by an executive
	- High level overview of details
	- Most Important items to be fixed based on severity
	- May include a graphical overview

- ### Overview of Assessment
	- Methodology leveraged during assessment
	- Details about execution of assessment
	- Tools used (e.g.; Nessus, OpenVAS)

- ### Scope
	- Everything that was authorized for the assessment 
	- Testing period of assessment

- ### Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
	- Details about findings after eliminating false positives by manual testing
